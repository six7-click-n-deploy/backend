    Visibility rules:
      * **Admins**: their own owned set (default), or — with
        ``?scope=course`` — every deployment whose owner sits in a
        course the admin is a designated teacher of (rare; admins are
        usually not in ``course_teachers`` rows, but the path is
        symmetric with the teacher one for consistency).
      * **Teachers** (default ``scope`` omitted): deployments they
        created (their own owned set). Cross-user listing is
        intentional UX: a teacher opens an individual deployment via
        direct link or via a student's profile page, not from this
        index.
      * **Teachers** (``?scope=course``): every non-deleted deployment
        whose owner sits in a course they teach (course-teacher
        inspect right, Phase 3). Optional ``?student=<userId>``
        narrows the listing to one course-member's deployments,
        which is what the student-profile page uses to render the
        deployments list of a single student under the teacher's care.
      * **Students** (and any non-staff role): deployments they own
        OR are a member of — either via a team mapping or a direct
        ``UserToDeployment`` row.

    The ``scope`` parameter is accepted only for teachers and admins;
    students passing it get the standard student listing back (the
    parameter is ignored, not rejected, to keep the API forgiving
    against query-string-builder bugs in the frontend).

      * each inner-map entry is one ``DeploymentFileUpload`` record
      * ``content_b64`` decodes cleanly (RFC 4648, padding optional)

#   * GET /{deployment_id}/resources?refresh=…
#       Stage-1 listing — parses the cached TF state and (default)
#       overlays live OpenStack lifecycle/hardware/addresses per VM.
#       Returns a flat list spanning compute, network, subnet, SG,
#       FIP, and port categories.
#
#   * GET /{deployment_id}/resources/{address}
#       Stage-2 detail — same shape, plus ports/SG-summary/volumes/
#       metadata for ONE compute instance, identified by its TF state
#       address (e.g. ``openstack_compute_instance_v2.team_ide["Team-A"]``).
#       Frontend loads this lazily when the user opens a card's drawer.
#
#   * POST /{deployment_id}/resources/{address}/redeploy
#       Per-VM redeploy — issues ``terraform apply -replace=<addr>
#       -target=<addr>`` in a dedicated Celery task. Strictly
#       address-whitelisted against the cached TF state and the
#       compute-instance category, so a hand-crafted POST can't smuggle
#       a network-resource target (which would tear down all team VMs).
#
# All three are owner-only — the data exposed (live OpenStack status,
# the ability to bounce a VM) is not something a teammate should be
# able to access through the deployment detail page.


# We accept the same Terraform address vocabulary the user would type
# on ``terraform apply -target=``: ``type.name`` with optional
# ``[<int>]`` or ``["<string>"]`` suffix. Multiple address segments
# (modules, nested resources) aren't supported by the current apps,
# so we keep the regex strict to make smuggling impossible. The
# resource-existence whitelist below is the real defense; the regex
# is just a fast no-op rejection for obviously bad inputs (e.g.
# pipes, semicolons, spaces).
