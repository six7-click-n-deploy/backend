    Aggregate counts for the dashboard KPI strip.

    Cheap DB-only aggregates — intentionally separated from the OpenStack
    quota call (`GET /quotas/overview`) so the dashboard renders fast even
    when the OpenStack API is slow or unavailable.

    Deployments counter MUST mirror the visibility rules of
    ``GET /deployments`` so the KPI matches what the user actually sees
    on the Deployments page:

      * Teacher/Admin: deployments they own.
      * Student:       deployments they own OR are a team member of OR
                       have a direct ``UserToDeployment`` mapping for.

    Apps counter MUST mirror the role-branched visibility of
    ``GET /apps`` (see ``routers/apps.py``):

      * Teacher/Admin: every non-deleted app — exactly what
        ``crud_apps.get_apps`` returns when called without
        ``user_id``. Staff sees the whole catalog including public-
        unapproved and private third-party apps; the KPI must too.
      * Student/regular: own apps (regardless of ``is_private`` /
        approval state) OR public apps (``is_private = False``)
        with at least one APPROVED version — mirrors
        ``crud_apps.get_visible_apps``.

    Soft-deleted rows (``deleted_at IS NOT NULL``) are excluded on both
    counters — same as the list endpoints.
