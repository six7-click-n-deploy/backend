"""Generic Terraform-state parser for the deployment status pipeline.

Reads the JSON blob persisted in ``Task.tf_state`` (produced by
``terraform state pull`` in the worker — see
``worker/app/tasks.py:collect_terraform_state``) and produces a flat,
typed list of resource entries the rest of the status pipeline can
join with live OpenStack data.

Design choices:

* **Whitelist of resource types**, not a free-form pass-through. The
  state file contains random_password / data sources / Terraform-
  internal resources we don't want to surface in the UI. We filter to
  the OpenStack resource kinds that map onto a meaningful UI card.

* **Address strings match ``terraform state list``** exactly — both
  for ``count.index`` and ``for_each`` instances. This is the same
  string the user passes to ``terraform apply -target=...`` /
  ``-replace=...``, so we can use it round-trip without translation.

* **Team-Tag extraction**: pulls ``metadata.team`` from
  Compute-Instance attributes. Apps that don't set the tag get
  ``team=None`` — the UI then renders the resource as ``Shared``.
  See the team-contract documentation in
  ``docs/app-author-guide.md`` for the contract this implements.

The parser is a pure function — no DB, no HTTP, no SDK calls. The
live-OpenStack join lives in ``deployment_status.py``.
