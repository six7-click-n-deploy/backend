"""SMTP email sender + Jinja2 template renderer for deployment notifications.

Sits in the backend (not the worker) because the listener that picks up
``task-succeeded`` already lives there and has DB access for resolving
user emails. The worker stays infrastructure-only.

Sending strategy:

* Gmail SMTP via ``settings.SMTP_*`` — App password required when 2FA is
  on. The kill-switch is ``settings.SMTP_ENABLED`` (off by default); set
  it to ``True`` and provide ``SMTP_USER`` / ``SMTP_PASSWORD`` to turn
  delivery on. With either condition missing, ``send_email`` becomes a
  no-op and returns ``False`` without raising.
* Port-aware connection: ``465`` opens an implicit-TLS connection
  (``SMTP_SSL``); anything else (typically ``587``) uses ``SMTP`` and
  upgrades via STARTTLS. Some corporate networks (SAP intranet
  included) block outbound 587 but allow 465 — switching is a config
  change, no code edit.
* MIME ``multipart/alternative`` with both an HTML and a plain-text
  body so clients without HTML rendering still see something legible.
  Templates live next to this file in ``templates/email/``.
* Each ``send_email`` is its own SMTP connection (no pooling). Gmail
  drops idle connections aggressively and the volume here is low —
  one mail per user per deploy. Reuse would just add reconnect-on-
  expired complexity.

Failures are logged at ``warning`` and swallowed: a failed mail must
never roll back a successful deployment. The listener checks the
return value if it wants to surface a "mail not sent" badge.
