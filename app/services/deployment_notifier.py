"""Build and send post-deploy notification mails.

Two flavours:

* ``send_user_mails(...)`` — one mail per user with their own access
  details and the list of teammates.
* ``send_owner_mail(...)`` — one mail to the deployment owner with
  every team's VM data and every user's credentials in one place.

Both consume the worker's terraform outputs (``team_vms``,
``user_accounts``, ``teams_summary``) plus the deployment's team/user
membership from the DB. The output shape is documented inline below
so a future template change doesn't have to re-discover it from a
real run.

Recipient freshness: every recipient is pulled from Keycloak
(``refresh_user_from_keycloak``) right before the mail is composed.
A deploy can run for many minutes between the wizard pick and the
notification, and the team member's address may have changed in the
meantime — refusing to refresh would silently send credentials to a
stale address. The refresh is best-effort: when Keycloak is down or
the user was deleted upstream we fall back to the DB record so a
flaky identity provider can't tank the entire notification flow.

Failures are logged at the call site and never bubble up — sending
mail is best-effort, the deploy itself is already done.

# Terraform's ``output -json`` produces, i.e. each top-level key is an
# output name with ``{value, type, sensitive}`` underneath. We only care
# about the ``value`` of three well-known outputs from the Online-IDE
# template (and any template that follows the same conventions):
#
#   team_vms.value:
#     {
#       "Team-1": {
#         "code_server_url": "http://1.2.3.4:8080",
#         "floating_ip":     "1.2.3.4",

#         "instance_id":     "uuid",
#         "instance_name":   "online-ide-Team-1"
#       },
#       ...
#     }
#
#   user_accounts.value:
#     {
#       "Team-1-luca": {
#         "auth":     "<password-or-key-or-login-url>",
#         "ip":       "1.2.3.4",
#         "port":     8080,
#         "type":     "password" | "ssh_key" | "oauth" | "none",
#         "username": "luca"
#       },
#       ...
#     }
#
#   Auth-type contract:
#     * ``password`` (default if omitted) — ``auth`` is the password
#       string. The mail prints a "Password" line.
#     * ``ssh_key``  — ``auth`` is the public key the user should use
#       (or a one-line hint about which key was pre-provisioned). The
#       mail prints an "SSH key" line in a monospace block.
#     * ``oauth``    — ``auth`` is the login URL the user should click
#       (e.g. an external IdP). The mail prints "Login via …" with
#       the URL.
#     * ``none``     — no credential is shipped (open dashboard, no
#       auth wall). ``auth`` may be omitted; the mail leaves out the
#       credentials block entirely and only ships URL/IP.
#   An unknown ``type`` falls back to ``password`` rendering for
#   safety (the mail still shows whatever ``auth`` value the app
#   produced rather than silently dropping it).
#
#   teams_summary.value: {"Team-1": 1, ...}  — member counts; not used
#                                              directly but useful as a
#                                              sanity check.
#
# When a template doesn't expose one of these (e.g. an app without
# per-user credentials), the helpers return empty dicts and the mail
# silently omits those sections.
